# Computer Graphics 

## Background

Computer graphics are used in the entertainment industry in video games and cinema (where movies have an increasing share of synthetic imagery), in television or medical imaging, among other fields.

These projects aim to provide and consolidate the theoretical-practical bases in the synthesis of visual information, as well as present more advanced techniques.

## Goals

The goal is to develop basic aspects of a 3D engine using a framework.

- Laboratory 1: 2D rasterization

- Laboratory 2: 3D Projection

- Lab 3: Rendering 3D meshes with triangles

- Lab 4: Introduction to GPU

- Laboratory 5: 3D lighting
